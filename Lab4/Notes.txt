▷ To pass Part 1:
Explain to the lab assistant:
(i) what is the TF-IDF measure
TF-IDF measure term frequencies among either one or multiple document, 
normalizing their values so that longer documents won't have a higher
prio over shorter documents. Some words are also weigthed to avoid,
some common words getting unnecessarily high scores.
(ii) how to use TF-IDF for:
– document similarity
Cosine similarity
– classify text
Adding NB 

▷ To pass Part 2:
Write a text classification pipeline to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative.
Find a good set of parameters for the pipeline you have created by using grid search.
Show your result to the lab assistant.

Original settings:
0.91
clf__alpha: 0.001
tfidf__use_idf: True
vect__ngram_range: (1, 2)

Best result:
0.9525
clf__alpha: 0.02
tfidf__smooth_idf: True
tfidf__use_idf: False
vect__binary: True
vect__max_df: 0.9
vect__min_df: 1
vect__ngram_range: (1, 2)
vect__stop_words: 'english'

▷ To pass Part 3:
(i) Explain the TextRank algorithm and how it works to the lab assistant.
 - Börja med att splita dokument till meningar.
 - Cosine similarity.
 - TextRank, används för att rangårdna meningarna. Väljer sedan de högst
    rankade som summary.
(ii) Show your lab assistant some summaries you created; and discuss the quality of the
summaries
 - Summaries seem kinda random, but they do sort of summarize the contents of the longer text.

Summary 'Murica:
 The US embassy recommends US citizens be prepared to immediately shelter in the event an air alert is announced.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would respond “appropriately” a day after Ukraine fired six of the newly approved US-made Atacms missiles into an ammunition warehouse in the south-western Bryansk region.

Summary Twitter:
 (Trigger Warning doesn’t go so far as to explicitly endorse the American characters’ actions in the scene, which amount to a war crime, but the film instead just kind of breezes past the issue.) Proclamations of a boycott should of course be taken with a grain of salt: grousing on social media doesn’t always equate to actual widespread outrage.
Underneath it all, Trigger Warning is simply too messy and poorly crafted a film to convey any kind of coherent political ethos.



(like; does your abstract make any sense? can you create a summary that looks like an
abstract from a news article? can you summarize product opinions from customers etc).
