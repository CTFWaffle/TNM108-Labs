Questions for Part1:
1. When can you use linear regression?
2. How can you generalize linear regression models to account for more complex relationships
among the data?
3. What are the basis functions?
4. How many basis functions can you use in the same regression model?
5. Can overfitting be a problem? And if so, what can you do about it?

Answers for Part1:
1. When you want to see linear relations between datasets.
2. By adding in a pipeline, more complex relationships among the data can more easily be 
accounted for by allowing higher dimensionality.
3. 
4. 
5. By implementing some form of regularization you can minimize overfitting, there are many 
regularization methods: Ridge and Lasso are mentioned in the lab for example.
